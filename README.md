# GoogleHashCode2020

This is my attempt on 2020 Google Hash competition.

Bad algorithm for sorting the order for library and books.

Example C nearly take over an hour to run, but other examples are fine.

In the online qualificaiton round, my team only score 16 marks due to bad management and having a slow start.

I tried finishing the rest after the competition ends, with more time understanding the question 
and coming up with some better algorithm, I am able to score 13,137,222 points, which makes my team being
on the 62th place in United Kingdom in Extended Round (not bad).

Tried some better algorithm for sorting the order of the libraries, but turns out it didn't work as expected, so
I stick to prioritise libraries with shorter sign up time and leave rest of my test code here.

<li>Score for example a: 21</li>
<li>Score for example b: 5,822,900</li>
<li>Score for example c: 5,467,966</li>
<li>Score for example d: 4,109,365</li>
<li>Score for example e: 4,367,100</li>
<li>Score for example f: 2,703,359</li>

<li>Total Score: 22,470,711</li>
