# GoogleHash2020

This is my attempt on 2020 Google Hash competition.

Bad algorithm for sorting the order for library and books.

Example C nearly take over an hour to run, but other examples are fine.

In the online qualificaiton round, my team only score 16 marks due to bad management and having a slow start.

I tried finishing the rest after the competition ends, with more time understanding the question 
and coming up with some better algorithm, I am able to score 13,137,222 points, which makes my team being
on the 91th place in United Kingdom in Extended Round (not bad).

<li>Score for example a: 21</li>
<li>Score for example b: 4,581,800</li>
<li>Score for example c: 2,441,996</li>
<li>Score for example d: 4,109,365</li>
<li>Score for example e: 479,683</li>
<li>Score for example f: 1,524,357</li>

Total Score: 13,137,222
